ARM Windows on Android (AWoA)

Welcome to AWoA! This is an open-source initiative to enable Arm version Windows to run smoothly on the Android Virtual machine, with KVM and GPU enabled, leveraging the growing capabilities of ARM-based hardware and the versatility of Android as a platform.

üöÄ Project Goals

1. KVM enabled Virtualization: Provide a high-performance virtual machine optimized for ARM-based Windows operating systems on Android devices.
2. GPU Acceleration: Leverage VirtIO-GPU to utilize Android's GPU resources, enhancing graphics performance for Windows on ARM.
3. Broad Device Compatibility: Support a wide range of Android devices, especially those powered by advanced ARM processors (e.g., Pixel 8 and other open source platforms).
4. Future-Ready Architecture: Build a foundation for integrating AI-driven features to enhance the user experience and explore next-generation desktop OS possibilities.

üóìÔ∏è Milestones

Phase 1: Foundation Development (0-3 Months)

1. Research and implement virtualization using QEMU with KVM acceleration on supported devices.
2. Test and evaluate ARM Windows compatibility on Android devices.
3. Create a proof-of-concept (PoC) with basic VM functionality.

Phase 2: Optimization & Features (3-6 Months)

1. Integrate VirtIO-GPU to enable hardware-accelerated graphics for Windows on ARM.
2. Further optimize with AI-based acceleration using device NPUs (e.g., Hexagon 780).
3. Develop a user-friendly interface for configuration and management.

Phase 3: Community Expansion & AI Integration (6+ Months)
1. Engage the open-source community to test, debug, and enhance features.
2. Add advanced AI-driven desktop productivity tools tailored for ARM Windows users.
3. Explore support for gaming or high-performance applications on this platform.
